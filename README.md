# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest

- Decision Tree is one of the most powerful and popular algorithm. Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables.

## What Is Ensemble Learning?
- Ensemble learning is a widely-used and preferred machine learning technique in which multiple individual models, often called base models, are combined to produce an effective optimal prediction model. The Random Forest algorithm is an example of ensemble learning.

## What Is Bagging in Machine Learning?
-Bagging, also known as Bootstrap aggregating, is an ensemble learning technique that helps to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. It is used to deal with bias-variance trade-offs and reduces the variance of a prediction model. Bagging avoids overfitting of data and is used for both regression and classification models, specifically for decision tree algorithms.
